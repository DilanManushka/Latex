It was seen in Chapter\ref{ch:Charger_basics}, that the fast charging requirement of applications like SCATMA and SRUPS are unique. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ability to extract the energy stored in the above mentioned inductor to charge a separate part of the same capacitor bank
	\item Ability to use a higher voltage to charge one part of the capacitor
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
L_a \aeq L_1 + L_2 + 2M,\\[1ex]
L_b \aeq L_1 - L_2 - 2M.
\end{align*}

By solving these two equations;

\begin{align}
\label{eq:La_Lb_M}
L_1 + L_2 \eq \frac{L_a +L_b}{2}~~~and~~~M\eq\frac{L_a - L_b}{4}.
\end{align}

The coupling coefficient~($k$) can be found using the following equation

\begin{align}
\label{eq:La_Lb_k}
k \eq \sqrt{\frac{M^2}{L_1L_2}}.
\end{align}

From the practical measurements the following values were obtained; $L_1=1.26~\text{mH},~ L_2\eq1.48~\text{mH},~l_p=19.9~\mu\text{H},~L_a\eq5.47~\text{mH}~and~L_b\eq31.21~\mu\text{H}$. Hence $L_1 + L_2\eq1.26 + 1.48~\text{mH}\eq 2.74~\text{mH}$. $L_1 + L_2$ can be obtained using $L_a ~\text{and}~ L_b$ according to Eq.~\ref{eq:La_Lb_M}. 

Mutual inductance can be calculated from Eq.~\ref{eq:La_Lb_M} 
\begin{align*}
M \eq \frac{5.47 - 0.031}{4}~\text{mH} \eq 1.36~\text{mH}.  
\end{align*}


The coupling coefficient calculated according to Eq.~\ref{eq:La_Lb_k}

\begin{align*}
k \eq \sqrt{\frac{1.36^2}{1.26 \times 1.48}}~~\implies~~ k \eq 0.995.
\end{align*}
